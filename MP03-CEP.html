							<p>Corporate Event Planner is a website that makes your event planning easy, efficient and successful. It helps you to organize and keep track of the events and collaborate with people on event planning.</p>
							<p>The steps I had gone through for the product design process:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Discovery: User interview</li>
								<li>Definition: Proto-persona</li>
								<li>Ideation: Brainstorm for problem-solving, User Flows</li>
								<li>Prototyping: Wireframe, Style guide/pattern library, InVision prototype</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Tools I used: Sketch, InVision, Whimsical, Milanote</p>
							<h2>1. User Interview</h2>
							<p>Diane, she worked as a coordinator in InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG®) for 3 years. Part of her job responsibility is organizing conferences, team meetings, and team buildings for her team. She plans about 14 events every year.</p>
							<h2>2. Proto-persona</h2>
							<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Proto-Persona.png" alt="Proto-persona" /></span>
							<h2>3. Brainstorm for problem-solving</h2>
							<h3>From MVP of the project:</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Primary target users: The people who plan events for their teams and companies, such as HR, Coordinator, or Admin Assistance.</li>
								<li>Basic functions: Event C.R.U.D.(create, read, update, delete)</li>
								<li>Basic elements of an event: Name, Description, Date and time, Budget, Vendors, Shopping list, To-do-list.</li>
								<li>Keyword: Event details, Keep track of events, People to coordinate</li>
								<li>Key features: Organized event details, Easy to track, Collaborate with people.</li>
							</ul>
							<h3>Study how to plan events:Organized event details</h3>

											<td>Event ratings: <br>Once the event has been launched, the user has an option to send ratings and comments request to all the attendants through the email. The system will collect the information and show in the past event.</td>

								<h2>4. User Flows</h2>
								<p>Based on the brainstorm for problem-solving, I created detailed user flows. It makes it easier to build the structure of the product for both designers and developers.</p>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/User-Flows.png" alt="User-Flows" /></span>
								<h2>5. Wireframe</h2>
								<p>To visualize the user flows, I created wireframes for main pages. It allows us to focus on the function of the product and prioritizes the content of each page.</p>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Wireframe.png" alt="Wireframe" /></span>
								<h2>6. Style guide/pattern library</h2>
								<p>For high-fidelity design, a style guide is necessary for keeping the consistency of the design. Considering the target user, I have decided to make it modern and clean.</p>
								<span class="image fit"><img src="images/Style-Guide.png" alt="Style-Guide" /></span>
								<h2>7. InVision Prototype</h2>
								<p>The image is showing the main pages of the high fidelity design for the corporate event planner. The link is for the complete InVision Prototype: <a href="https://invis.io/V2S1IGBE8F4">https://invis.io/V2S1IGBE8F4</a></p>
